Bilbo-Hand Fine v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hey! You've downloaded the font "Bilbo-Hand Fine"! 
To install, drop the file into the following directory:

c:\windows\fonts

To utilize the markings above the vowels, capitalize those vowels.  There are no other capitals in this set, as Bilbo's handwriting doesn't use them.

Regards,
Nancy Lorenz.
