## Description

The Middle-Earth Compendum is a collection of Characters from JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings universe. The characters are filtered into  five different races (Men, Elves, Maiar, Dwarves, and Orc-Kind) and are displayed on the page once a race has been selected.  Information about a character will be displayed when a character is selected.  There is also a search within each page of characters that will search through all characters on the page.  There is also a form to create a new character that can be added to any of the pages of characters.

## User Navigation

As a user, you will be able to search for characters based on the five races provided in the home page. After clicking on your desired race, you will be brought to a page consisting of characters from that race. 

You can navigate down the list characters in the page by scrolling or you can search for a specific character of that race by typing into the search bar.

By clicking on a character you can display their Name, Culture, Gender, as well as information about the character.

As a user, you can add a new character to any of the races by clicking the add new character button on the homepage.

You can return to the home page at any point by clicking on the Middle-Earth Compendium button in the top left of each page.
